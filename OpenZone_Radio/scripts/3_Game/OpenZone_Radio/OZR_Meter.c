// WHAT THIS IS FOR. When a server stalls with many players on it, the
// question is never "how expensive is one call" -- that can be measured on an
// empty stand -- but "how many times per minute does it fire with sixty people
// online", which cannot. These counters answer the second question on the
// live server, in one log line a minute, and cost one static bool read per
// hooked call while switched off.
//
// WHY NOT THE ENGINE'S OWN EnProfiler. It only exists in the Diag build: the
// retail DayZServer_x64.exe carries none of its bindings (checked against the
// binary 2026-09-12), so a debug mode built on it would be dead on every real
// server.
//
// Switched on by `Profiler` in OZ_Radio_Settings.json (OZR_Settings.ServerLoad
// is the only caller of SetOn). Everything here is server-side bookkeeping;
// the client never sees it.
